# Undirected & Unweighted Graph Java Implementation
  
An implementation of an undirected unweighted graph in java.  
This project implements three different interfaces introduced in our assignment:  
  
- node_data (implemented by NodeData) - an object representing each individual node/vertex in the graph  
- graph (implemented by Graph_DS) - an object representing a graph tha points to all of its containing nodes  
- graph_algorithms (implemented by Graph_Algo) - an object that implements some basic graph algorithms  
  
- Our main data structure of choice is a **HashMap** that is used to store every nodes neighbors in the **NodeData** object  
and every graph's nodes in **Graph_DS** object.  
  
- The main reasons we chose HashMap is because the efficiency for our projects needed methods.  
For example the efficient put(), get() and contains() are all O(1) and most importantly the values() method that  
returns a **Collection** view of all the values contained in this map. The values() is perfect for the implementation  
of our getV() method which returns the nodes or neighbors of a selected node in a graph.  
The getV() method is used almost in every algorithm and iteration in this project.  
  
## Main Classes and Methods  
### NodeData  
> By definition this class should not be accessible directly and is implemented this way only in the first project. So we will explain the needed methods in the Graph_DS class. 
  
### Graph_DS
- `Graph_DS()` - Default constructor
- `getNode()` - Returns a node by the nodeKey
- `hasEdge()` - Checks is two nodes are connected
  > O(1) Complexity
- `addNode()` - Adds a new node to the graph
  > O(1) Complexity
- `connect()` - Connects two nodes in the graph
  > O(1) Complexity
- `getV()` - Returns a collection view of the graph
  > if given a specific nodeKey this method will return a collection view of it's connected neighbors
  > O(1) Complexity by using values() method of HashMap
- `removeNode` - Removed a node from the graph
  > O(n) Complexity
- `removeEdge()` - Remove an edge between two nodes in the graph
  > O(1) Complexity
- `nodeSize()` - Returns the number of the nodes in the graph
  > O(1) Complexity
- `edgeSize()` - Returns the number of the edges in the graph
  > O(1) Complexity
- `getMC()` - Returns the number of mode counts in the graph
  > Every change in the internal state of the graph counts as a mode count
  > O(1) Complexity

### Graph_Algo
- `init` - Initialize the graph
- `copy()` - Creates a deep copy of the graph
- `isConnected()` - Checks if the graph is connected
- `shortestPathDist()` - Returns the length of te shortest path between two nodes
  > if non existent returns -1
- `shortestPath()` - Returns a List<node_data> of the shortest path between two nodes
  > if non existent returns null
