Undirected & Unweighted Graph

In this project we implement and undirected graph by implementing three different interfaces:

node_data (NodeData) - an object representing each individual node/vertex in the graph
graph (Graph_DS) - an object representing a graph tha points to all of its containing nodes
graph_algorithms (Graph_Algo) - an object that implements some basic graph algorithms

Our main data structure of choice is a HashMap that we will use to store every nodes neighbors and every graph's node
The main reason we chose this data structure is for the efficient put(),
